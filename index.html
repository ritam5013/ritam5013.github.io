                    CNSD is a regular series of meetings on nonlinear dynamics and complex systems held in India approximately once every year. These conferences bring together a very large fraction of researchers within India working on integrable and chaotic systems, complex networks, time series analysis, and their uses in modeling phenomena in engineering, biological, and physical sciences. The 14th edition of CNSD will be held at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune. In addition to the above mentioned topics, this edition aims to focus on emerging areas at the intersection of dynamics, data science, and machine learning and applications in medical sciences.
